    - Backend Dev Or FullStack
    - Designer
    - Frontend Dev

## 💡 Ideas
- Creating a voting system so public votes on top 50 - 100 portfolios
- Judges will vote on top 10. Top ten winners will get same prize as everyone else. You'll just get more bragging rights
- We may end up making this a multi day hackathon

## 🧐 What Dennis Is Trying To Solve
- How can we make mass voting ethical so people don't vote for "bad" projects just to increase their chances?
- How do we make the competition fair for devs who may not be skilled in design? Ex: Backend devs competing against designers, not really fair.
